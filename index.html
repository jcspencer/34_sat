                Introduction
              </h2>

              <p>
                In Australia, there is an ongoing debate about whether attending an independent school versus a non-independent school results in students achieving a higher ATAR (Australian Tertiary Admission Rank) score at the end of Year 12.
              </p>

              <p>
                This research project will attempt to answer the following question:
              </p>

              <p>
                <blockquote>
                  Is there any correlation between a school's fees and it's average Year 12 results?
                </blockquote>
              </p>

              <h3>
                Discussion and Research
              </h3>

              <p>
                Literature and media throughout Australia seems to suggest that there is a range of different theories
                as to whether private schools are better than public schools and vice versa.
              </p>

              <p>
                An article titled <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com.au/the-great-school-debate-public-versus-private-education-2015-6">The Great School Debate: Public versus private education</a> by Business Insider discusses this issue, displaying arguments from both sides of the debate.
              </p>

              <p>
                The article follows researcher Barbara Preston, who argues that state school educated children actually do better at university than those who attend a private or independent school.
              </p>

              <p>
                In response, a letter written by Geoff Ryan, CEO of the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia (AHISA), who claimed that:
                <blockquote>
                  “On average, students in independent schools score six ATAR points higher than students in government schools, after taking into account both student socioeconomic status and student prior achievement.”
                  ...
                  “recent claims that there is no academic benefit for students in attending an independent school are wrong.”

              <p>
                Another article, titled <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/private-v-public-schooling-20150416-1mm8bn.html">Private v Public schooling</a> by the Sydney Morning Herald quotes
                Save Our Schools spokesman Trevor Cobbold as saying that:
                <blockquote>
                  <p>"If you think you are getting some advantage in education outcomes from sending your child to a private school rather than a government school, think again."</p>

                The information in these articles and video demonstrates that there are many reasonable arguments to support both types
                of education in Victoria.

                However, many of these arguments are highly subjective and do not look at the actual <i>data</i>.
              </p>

              <p>
                In this project, we will only explore the direct relationship between educational sectors
                of Victorian secondary schools and their average study scores.

                This will be approached by examining data set containing purely statistical information published
                by the <i>Department of Education</i> and the <i>Victorian Correction and Assessment Authority</i>
                about the performance of schools around the state.

              <h3>
                Hypothesis
              </h3>

              <p>
                The project set out with the following hypothesis:
              </p>

              <blockquote>
                "If a school is independently funded then the school’s average scaled study score will be higher than government and Catholic schools in Victoria. This is because, theoretically, the school has more money to spend on its students."
              </blockquote>

              <h4>
                Scope
              </h4>

              <p>
                This study is limited to schools in Victoria who had students enrolled in VCE in 2015.
                This does not include the scores of students partaking in the International Baccalaureate (IB) program, for example.
              </p>

              <h4>
                Data Sets
              </h4>

              <p>
                This analysis will use two key datasets:
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>The first dataset is from the DEECD via <i>Data.gov.au</i> <sup><a href="#references">[1]</a></sup>. It contains information such as the name, educational sector and location of every school in Victoria.</li>
                <li>The second dataset is from the VCAA <sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup>. It contains the median study scores for each school partaking in the VCE in 2015.</li>
              </ol>

              <p>
                These datasets will be combined to create a set of data that gives the name, educational sector, region, number of students and the median study score of each school school in Victoria.

              <p>
                The first analysis looked at averages around the state.

                This compared independent schools to catholic and government based solely on scaled study scores.

                <h3>
                  Preliminary Conclusion
                </h3>

                <p>
                  This concludes that, overall, independent schools have median study scores higher than Catholic schools (by two points) and government schools (by four points).

                  This confirms the first part of the original hypothesis, “If a school is independently funded then the school’s average scaled study score will higher than government and Catholic schools in Victoria. This is because, theoretically, the school has more money to spend on its students.”

              <p>
                Next, we modified the our first analysis to split the schools into their  <a href="javascript:;" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Barwon South Western, Gippsland, Grampians, Hume, Loddon Mallee and Northern, Southern, Eastern and Western Metropolitan">regions in Victoria</a> before calculating their weighted average study scores.
              </p>

              <p>
                This was designed to identify if the location of a school contributed to its average study score. It also aimed to identify if the average scores of all educational sectors were affected by the location of schools.

                Conclusion
              </h2>

              <p>
                This concludes that the location of a school <i>somewhat</i> contributes to the school’s median study score, 
                regardless of the school sector.
              </p>

              <p>
                However, there are a number of exceptions where one particular type of school performs significantly
                lower than others in a particular region and we cannot find specific reasoning for these outliers given the data available.
              </p>

              <p>
                For example, in the Grampians region, government and Catholic schools are below average, but independent schools are above average.
              </p>

              <p>
                The results show that the median study score differed by around three points points region-to-region. 
                This identifies that, although some sectors may have a better overall score, some regions perform better than others, regardless of the type of school.

                Finally, we collected data that combined the name, median study score and the annual fees for <i>10</i> independent schools around the state.
                This was designed to test whether an increase in school fees actually has any effect on study scores.
              </p>

              <p>
                To create this table, we randomly selected five metropolitan schools and five regional schools from the dataset.
              </p>

              <p>
                We then browsed their websites to gather the value of their annual school fees (for a VCE student).

              In statistics, there is a number called the 'correlation coefficient' (r<sup>2</sup>), which shows how much one variable effects another.


              In the case of this data, it shows how much school fees effect study scores.

              Here, r<sup>2</sup> equals ~0.21, meaning that there is <i>little to no correlation</i> between school fees and study scores.
            </div>

            <p>
              This concludes that there is <b>not</b> a strong relationship between school fees and median study scores, meaning that school fees have actually little to no effect on the median study scores of a school.

            <p>
              This refutes the second part of the original hypothesis,

              “If a school is independently funded then the school’s average scaled study score will be higher than government and Catholic schools in Victoria. <b>This is because, theoretically, the school has more money to spend on its students.</b>”

               Conclusion
              </h2>

              <p>
                This project set out to discover whether independent schools earn better study scores than government and Catholic schools.
                
                The idea behind this is that these schools theoretically have more money to spend on their students.
              </p>

              <p>
                The evidence collected confirms <i>part</i> of original hypothesis. 
                <ul>
                  <li>The average study score for Independent schools was higher than Catholic schools and Government schools; however</li>
                  <li>there was not a relationship between school fees and median study scores for schools.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>

              <p>
                However, correlation does not imply causation.
                It simply cannot be confirmed if an increase in study scores is directly caused by an increase in school fees given the data we have available.
              </p>

              <p>
                It is beyond the scope of this project to understand other factors that may contribute to study scores, such as student socioeconomic status (which was not researched).
              </p>

                Future Work
              </h3>
              <p>
                Consideration could be given to improving the understanding of the results with further research in this area to reveal the underlying cause by taking more factors into account.
                It would also be interesting to increase the sample size to around 200 independent schools to ensure a better representation of school fees vs median study scores from a wider variety of regions.
